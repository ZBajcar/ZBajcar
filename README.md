## Hi there 👋, I'm Zach

I'm a Software Engineer in **Poughkeepsie, New York**, passionate about building **smart, scalable systems**. I code mainly in **TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and PostgreSQL** and co-created **[Burrow](https://burrow-io.github.io/)** - an open-source data ingestion pipeline that streamlines RAG application development.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me **walking my dog, exploring new restaurants around the city, or lifting heavy things at the gym**.

## ⚡ Burrow

[Burrow](https://burrow-io.github.io/) is a self-hosted data ingestion pipeline and retrieval API that streamlines and accelerates the development of RAG applications. It transforms unstructured documents into searchable vector embeddings with advanced parsing, and allows retrieval with techniques such as hybrid search, metadata filtering and reranking.

**Technologies Used:** Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Terraform, AWS (ECS, Lambda, ALB, EventBridge, SQS, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, CloudFront)
